DESCRIPTION :  The Online Learning Platform is a comprehensive web application designed to facilitate virtual education and training through video-based lessons, interactive quizzes, user authentication, and progress tracking. This platform was built to provide learners with a structured and engaging learning experience from the comfort of their homes. It is especially useful for educational institutions, tutors, and e-learning startups looking to deliver content digitally.

The platform allows users to register or log in, watch lesson videos, take related quizzes, and track their learning progress. It includes a simple and intuitive user interface that makes navigation easy for students of all ages. The backend is powered by Flask (a Python web framework), while the frontend uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. All media and quiz content are managed via a structured directory system and HTML templates.

Objective:
The goal of the project is to create a fully functional and responsive online education platform that:

Enables authenticated users to access video lessons.

Includes quizzes to assess understanding after each lesson.

Tracks user progress and displays performance.

Offers a clean and accessible UI/UX design.

Demonstrates practical implementation of full-stack web development concepts.
